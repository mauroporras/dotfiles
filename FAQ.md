# FAQ

## Alacritty

### Why not to use custom window decoration?

- It could make the titlebar useless.
- Sometimes it's necessary to select text from the very top of the window and it ends up moving the whole window.

### Why to use 14pt font size?

- It's easier to read.
- You can always zoom out when necessary (<kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>-</kbd>).
- You can creante new Alacritty instances (<kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>n</kbd>) with defferent zoom levels. E.g.: one window just for logs.
