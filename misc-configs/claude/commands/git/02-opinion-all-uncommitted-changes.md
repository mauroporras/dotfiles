description: I want your opinion on ALL the uncommitted Git changes
---

Run these commands and these commands ONLY:

1. `git status --short` to get an overview of changes
2. `git diff` and `git diff --staged` to understand the changes

Then provide your opinion on:

- Code quality and style consistency with the existing codebase
- Potential bugs, edge cases, or issues
- Whether the changes are well-structured and focused
- Any other suggestions for improvements

Keep your feedback concise and actionable.
