## Context

- Current Git status: !`git status --short`
- Unstaged changes: !`git diff`
- Staged changes: !`git diff --staged`

## Your task

Provide your opinion on:

- Code quality and style consistency with the existing codebase
- Potential bugs, edge cases, or issues
- Whether the changes are well-structured and focused
- Any other suggestions for improvements

Keep your feedback concise and actionable.

Do NOT:

- Run additional `git status`, `git log`, `git diff`, or `git add` commands.
