description: Commit staged changes, don't push
---

Commit CURRENTLY STAGED CHANGES ONLY.
- Always re-check the currently staged changes before committing
- Do NOT run `git add` - only commit what is already staged
- Do NOT stage additional files
- Don't mention Claude anywhere (no free marketing)
- Don't push to the remote repository
