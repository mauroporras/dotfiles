description: Create a new branch for the current Git changes
---

The branch name must be descriptive based on the current Git changes (e.g., `fix/typo-in-readme`, `feat/add-validation`)

Run these commands and these commands ONLY:

1. `git status --short` to get an overview of changes
2. `git diff` and `git diff --staged` to understand the changes
3. `git checkout -b <branch-name>` to create and switch to the new branch

Do NOT commit the changes
Do NOT push to remote
