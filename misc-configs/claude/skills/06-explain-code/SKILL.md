description: explain code with visual diagrams and analogies
---

When explaining code, always include:

1. **Start with an analogy**: compare the code to something from everyday life
2. **Draw a diagram**: use ASCII art to show the flow, structure, or relationships
3. **Walk through the code**: explain step-by-step what happens
4. **Highlight any gotchas**: any common mistakes or misconceptions?

Keep explanations conversational. For complex concepts, use multiple analogies.
