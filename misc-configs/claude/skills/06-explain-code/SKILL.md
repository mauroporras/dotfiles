When explaining code, always include:

1. **TL;DR first**: summarize what the code does
2. **Analogy**: compare it to something from everyday life
3. **Walk through the code**: explain step-by-step what happens
4. **Diagram**: use ASCII art appropriate to the code:
   - Flowchart for control flow / algorithms
   - Box diagram for data structures / state
   - Sequence diagram for interactions between components
5. **Design rationale**: why was it written this way? What trade-offs were made?
6. **Gotchas**: common mistakes, edge cases, or misconceptions

Keep explanations conversational. For complex concepts, use multiple analogies.
